## Who is behind EQness?

My name is Olga-Lucia Gamboa Arana, I am a neuroscientist with a PhD in Basic and Clinical Neurology.  
I am passionate about human emotions and their consequences. That drove me to get a specialization in Emotional Education, get certified as a teacher of the mindfulness eating program MB_EAT and trained as a teacher of Mindfulness and Self Compassion and I am finalizing my studies in Psychology.  
I am also a life coach, happy to share my knowledge with those seeking to modify painful behavioral patterns to achieve a healthier and happier life.

This is me: {numref}`portrait-Lu`!

### Be committed!
Improving our quality of life requires effort and therefore a strong will to make changes. It is not about being someone that we are not, but to become better versions of what we currently are. Of course mistakes will occur during this process, but it is important to learn from them and continue or start over again.

### Be Dedicated!
The path to develop an emotionally healthy and satisfying life is not covered in a week, nor in a year. Time is needed when we want to change our old unhealthy patterns for new ones, more appropriate to our values, needs and life goals . To achieve this, daily work is necessary. However, this dedication is so rewarding and it is the greatest gift we can ever give ourselves.
